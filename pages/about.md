Alda Yuan works on public health and environmental law. She graduated with her JD and probably several complexes from Yale Law School in 2018. She lives with her partner and her cat, an adorable orange menace who only occasionally answers to the name Artemis. In addition to fiction, she writes on healthcare policy, space law, and open science. She is the author of a DIY guide on institutional change for racial equity called With a Lever. 

She is also the creator of the [Integral States Project](https://www.integralstatesproject.com/), which reimagines the states and territories as fantasy maps as a catalyst for thinking about the arbitrary nature of borders as well as the pre-colonial history of those lands.
