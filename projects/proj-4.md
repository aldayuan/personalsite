I'm an avid table top rpg player and have done some writing, editing, and content creation for the hobby.  

[Crypts and Chimeras](https://aldayuan.itch.io/crypts-and-chimeras-1e) (writer) - a 1 page rules-lite fantasy RPG designed to help you start playing as quickly as possible, with as little fuss as possible  
 
<br>
[In*die zine](https://indie-zine.itch.io/)(writer and editor) - a zine with supplements for table top games and articles about game design.  
 <ul>
  <li>The Maven Guide (writer) - drop in locations for rpg games in the style of restaurant reviews </li>
  <li>Social Deconstruction (writer) - a game about gender identity </li>
  <li>Unionize (editor) - a card game that simulates the process of creating a union  </li>
</ul>

[Unbreakable RPG](https://t.co/vdYX5oZVb3?amp=1) (editor) - volumes that collect Asian myth and folklore themed adventures written for d&d 5e as well as other rpg systems

[Everglade Gladiators Recipe Book](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/314359/Everglade-Gladiators-Recipe-Book-Vol-1) (writer) - eight satirical recipes such as Abyssal Chicken & Waffles and Trollboar Bacon Strips for fantasy tabletop rpg settings, which can be used to fill out a tavern menu or serve as a basis for a silly sidequest.

[Integral States Project](https://aldayuan.itch.io/) (artist, writer) - though this is an art project, the output is a series of US states and territories as fantasy maps, available as full size digital downloads on itch. The blank versions can be used for campaign maps.
